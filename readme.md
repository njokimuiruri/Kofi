Relative/position static is the same as static but lets you add top, and bottom features
position absolute removes an element from the flow of the parent element
Parent has to be relative or absolute for top,right,left bottom to work
in block elements browsers respect the width and height top and bottom margin
in inline elements browsers do not respect the height width bottom and top margins
display to be inline-block it does not start in a new line but browser respects the margin width and height
when centering inline elements we work w the parent element
when we want to center a block element: target margin, top bottom and left,right ( should be set to auto)
